The brokerclient should probably be converted to use the Twisted
  Endpoints APIs
Currently brokerclient uses an internal implementation detail of the
  twisted connector (connector.state), since otherwise it's impossible
  to know whether to expect a callback to clientConnectionLost or
  clientConnectionFailed when shutting down the connection. This
  wouldn't be necessary under the Endpoints APIs.
